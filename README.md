# Presti

## How to run

Build the source using elm-make in the `src` directory

    $ elm-make Presti.elm
    
We also need the file `glue.js`. This can be generated by executing `glue.js.sh`.

    $ bash js/glue.js.sh

This script assumes you have a variable `BACKEND_URL` in your environment. This will be added to the `.js` source in the appropriate places. I did it this way because I don't know of a better way to make the backend URL configurable in a Docker container.

After that, just open `index.html` in your browser!
